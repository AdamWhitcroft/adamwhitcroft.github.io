A personal project to depict the '[Big 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_five_game)', a term for a group of animals notoriously difficult to hunt on foot. While I abhor hunting unless your life depends on it, I am fiercly proud of being South African. This project was a small personal homage to that.
