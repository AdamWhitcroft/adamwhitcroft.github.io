My first freely available icon collection.	The set contains over 70 icons of various weather conditions. The icons became prolific on Dribbble shortly after their release, with hundreds of weather-app designs using them.

The icons have been featured in popular weather apps in both the App Store and Google Play Store, print media, travel websites including [Snow Bird](http://www.snowbird.com/) and most notably in Honda's "The Endless Road" interactive YouTube video (the making of which, and more usage of Climacons, can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/pU7za8viorE?t=1m39s)).
