Moving cities or countries is always tough. You're not familiar with the area, where to eat and the people who live around you. The concept of this app was to try and help this. People can join as hosts or attendees - or both. Hosts hold open food clubs at their homes when it suits them, while attendees can book a date and time and pay to attend. The idea is to encourage people to get to know those around them, and to support home food clubs.

Hosts could offer anything from a fresh organic breakfast to a full home cooked roast dinner. Hosts also set the cost of their meal, and since they aren't covering things like waitstaff and other overheads associated with restaurants, meals will be cheaper.

Attendees leave feedback on hosts, and hosts rate attendees. When an attendee books a meal, the host can accept or deny based on the reputation of the attendee; this stops nuisance customers and bad hosts.

The name *L'cater* is a playful mashup of the words *location* and *cater*.
