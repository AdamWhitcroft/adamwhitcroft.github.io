In homes where children have full access to anything on the internet, there is a fine line to walk between making sure they are safe and invading their privacy. The concept of this app is to solve this. At it's core, it's a fairly simple network activity monitoring application, but it has a few added features.

At a glance you can see which devices are connected to your network, either wirelessly or via cable, as well as network status and health. Accessing a single device in the device list will provide information such as connection time and data transfer. You can easily 'pause' a profile if you feel your child should get some work done, or revoke access entirely.

Profiles can also be created to limit activity during family time, or when you child should be sleeping.
