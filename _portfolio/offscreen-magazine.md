I was commissioned by [Offscreen Magazine](http://www.offscreenmag.com/issue5/) to create a collection of icons depicting well known buildings from 14 cities around the world for their fifth issue feature "A Web Workers Field Guide". I worked closely with Kai and after many rounds of revisions and tweaking, we arrived at the complete set you see below.
