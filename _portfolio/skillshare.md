I was commissioned by the kind folks over at [Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com/) to create a class for their learning platform detailing my icon creation process. I worked closely with them to plan and record a detailed narrated walkthrough of my entire icon pipeline, start to finish. 

Project steps were created after each chapter to encourage students to take part in the class, increasing engagement and ultimately enhancing their learning experience.

To date the class has 6,700 students (and counting) and has a 97% positive review response.
