I'm a massive gamer, spending a fair amount of time on Steam. Their mobile app, while all-encompassing, is overkill for my needs 90% of the time. The concept of this app is a simplified offering giving users a smaller feature set, but one more focussed on interaction with their friends and other players.

Catch up with your Steam friends, or watch them clutch a round on Inferno. You'll also be able to search by game for anyone streaming publically.
