I became a father recently, which prompted a dramatic uptick in "book time". Of the books I've read, _Cribsheet: A Data-Driven Guide to Better, More Relaxed Parenting, from Birth to Preschool_ by Emily Oster stands out as being the most helpful and assuring. The book is thoroughly enjoyable to read and offers only fact and not opinion.

Buy the book on [Bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org/books/cribsheet-a-data-driven-guide-to-better-more-relaxed-parenting-from-birth-to-preschool/9780525559276).
