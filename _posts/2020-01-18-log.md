I became a father recently, which prompted a dramatic uptick in "book time". Of the books I've read, *Cribsheet: A Data-Driven Guide to Better, More Relaxed Parenting, from Birth to Preschool* by Emily Oster stands out as being the most helpful and assuring. The book is data-driven, lacking in opinion and thoroughly enjoyable to read.

Buy the book on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Cribsheet-Data-Driven-Relaxed-Parenting-Preschool/dp/0525559256).
