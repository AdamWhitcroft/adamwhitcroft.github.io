	<h2>On Batch</h2>

	
	<p class="post-time">November 21, 2012</p>
	

	<p>Today I launched <a href="http://adamwhitcroft.com/batch/">Batch</a>, a 300 piece icon kit for web and user interface design. I am tremendously proud of what Iâ€™ve done with this kit and the reaction itâ€™s had so far has been simply overwhelming.</p>

<p>Batch was released with a price-tag attached. The first time Iâ€™ve charged for non-client work. This was strange for me, as Iâ€™m very much in the spirit of giving things back to a community that has given me so much. The decision to charge for this pack did not come lightly, and I spent a great deal of time trying to attach a number to something I created with no intention of selling initially.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, the site has had just shy of 900 visits. Of those, 78 went through to Gumroad, and of that, 2 purchases were made. Thatâ€™s a pretty telling story in of itself.</p>

<p>Batch has been widely circulated on Twitter and the feedback Iâ€™ve gotten on <a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/824696-Batch-300-Pictographs-for-Web-User-Interface-Design">Dribbble</a> has been nothing but positive, but the numbers just werenâ€™t what I wanted.</p>

<p>I realised that I had made a mistake. I didnâ€™t start Batch with the aim of selling it, and I was never truly convinced I should.</p>

<p>I want to see Batch in as many designs as possible. I want it to be a resources designers will revert to happily and often, and without the fear of forgetting a silly attribution link.</p>

<p>I want Batch to be something people use, not something they buy.</p>

<p>Batch is now available for free.</p>

<p><em>To those who have purchased Batch: You have been fully refunded. Thank you for your support, you are tremendous.</em></p>

<h3 id="the-reaction">The reaction</h3>

<p>The reaction to this bit of news was a bit of a surprise. Mentions and visits shot up which is always great, but the reaction from some of my peers and people I respect caught me completely off guard. It seems, to some, that by changing my mind and removing the price tag I had undersold myself.</p>

<p>I take what I do very seriously, and I have a tremendous amount of respect for my industry and my craft. I spent a great deal of time on Batch making sure it was the best it could possibly be before taking it public. I spent hours fettling the smallest details most will probably never see. Why?</p>

<p>Because it makes me happy.</p>

<p>I didnâ€™t get into this industry to make money. I got into it because designing stuff makes me happy. What makes me even happier is knowing that something Iâ€™ve made has helped someone else, in whatever small way that may be.</p>

<p>If removing an arbitrary dollar value from something Iâ€™ve made because Iâ€™d like it to reach more people means Iâ€™ve sold myself short, so be it.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m in this for me.</p>
