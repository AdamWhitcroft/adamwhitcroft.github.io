### About me

I work at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) as a Senior Staff Product Designer. I help teams in our Deliver product line ship approachable and efficient tools for merchants to manage their orders and inventory. I also spend a lot of time helping crafters grow their product design and critical thinking skills.

A few years earlier, I led the redesign of Shopify's icon ecosystem across web and multiple mobile apps. The end result was a visually unified and streamlined library of icons unique to Shopify. I also wrote comprehensive construcion documentation, empowering teams to contribute to the system independently of me.

In 2020 I worked with a few people at Shopify to design and build a COVID exposure notification mobile app. The open-source framework is now the offical exposure notification app of Canada.

I live in Ottawa with my wife, daughter and Husky.

#### Projects

[Gauntlet](https://gauntletapp.com/) -- If you play Magic: The Gathering in any format, you should use this app.

_Habitally_ -- An accountability app (in development).

_Dig_ -- A card game (in development).

_Spell Mastery_ -- A YouTube channel (in development).

I also used to maintain several popular icon librarires (_Batch_ and _Climacons_) but those--and most of my other side projects--have been retired so I have space for new things.

#### Interests

I'm into Yoga, Photography[^1], Magic: The Gathering, Dota 2 and making stuff in 3D. Vegan and alcohol-free since 2017.
