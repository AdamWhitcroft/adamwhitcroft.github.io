### About me

I'm a product designer currently living in Canada.

I work at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) as a Staff Product Designer. I help individual contributors and leads across our Deliver product line ship approachable and efficient tools for merchants to manage their orders and inventory. I also spend a lot of time mentoring crafters through weekly Office Hours and 1:1 pairing sessions.

Before that, I lead the redesign of Shopify's icon ecosystem which spans web and multiple mobile apps. The end result was a visually unified and streamlined library of icons unique to Shopify. I also wrote comprehensive construcion documentation, allowing crafters to own their own contributions to the system.

In 2020 I worked with a few people at Shopify to design and build a COVID exposure notification mobile app. The framework was adopted by the Canadian Government and is now the offical EN app in Canada.

#### Projects

[Habitally]() -- Coming soon.

[Gauntlet](https://gauntletapp.com/) -- An app for folks who play Magic: The Gathering. Hands down the best iOS app for tracking your decks, game history and life totals. If you play MTG, in any format, you should try the app out.

I used to maintain a number of icon projects, but I retired them all in 2020.

#### Interests

I'm into Veganism, Yoga, Photography[^1], Magic: The Gathering, Dota 2 and making stuff in 3D.
