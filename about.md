### About me

I'm a product designer currently living in Canada.

I work at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) as a Staff Product Designer in the Deliver product line. I help individual contributors and leads across our Deliver product line ship approachable solutions to merchant problems. I also spend a lot of time working on the future of our area, while mentoring crafters through Office Hours and 1:1 pairing sessions.

Before that, I lead the redesign of Shopify's icon ecosystem spanning web and multiple mobile apps. The process took several months but the end result was a visually coherent and streamlined library of icons unique to Shopify. Along with designing the new icon suite, I wrote comprehensive guidelines empowering teams and individuals to own their own contributions to the system.

In 2020 I worked with a few people at Shopify to build the pilot version of Canada's COVID exposure notification mobile app.

#### Interests

I'm into Veganism, Yoga, Photography[^1], Magic: The Gathering, Dota 2 and making stuff in 3D.

#### Projects

[Habitally]() -- Coming soon.

[Gauntlet](https://gauntletapp.com/) -- An app for folks who play Magic: The Gathering. Hands down the best iOS app for tracking your decks, game history and life totals. If you play MTG, in any format, you should try the app out.

I used to maintain a number of icon projects, but I retired them all in 2020.
