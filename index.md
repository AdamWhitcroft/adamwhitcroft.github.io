I work at Shopify, focussing on improving the quality of our admin experiences across web and mobile. Before that I helped teams design and ship tools used by our merchants to manage their orders and inventory at scale. I created Shopify's first icon library and continue to design icons for features and teams today.

Iâ€™m also building an app called [Gauntlet](http://gauntletapp.com/) with a friend.

### Icons

A selection of personal icons, coming soon.
