I've worked at Shopify since 2016, where I'm currently a Staff Designer. I help teams design and ship tools used by more than a million merchants to manage their orders and inventory. Before that, I led the redesign of Shopify's icon ecosystem.

I'm also building an app called [Gauntlet](http://gauntletapp.com/) with a friend.
