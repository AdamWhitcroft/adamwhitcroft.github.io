I've worked at Shopify since 2016, where I'm currently a Staff Designer. I help teams design and ship high quality order and inventory management tools our one million merchants use daily.

I'm building an app called [Gauntlet](http://gauntletapp.com/) with a friend. If you're into Magic: The Gathering check it out.

Find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AdamWhitcroft), where I don't talk about product design at all; it's mostly gaming, 3D or MTG related.
