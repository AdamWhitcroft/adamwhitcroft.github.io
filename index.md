I've worked at Shopify since 2016, where I'm currently a Staff Designer. I spend my time helping the teams in our Logistics product line design and ship tools used by over one million merchants to process their orders.

I live in Ottawa with my wife, our daughter and our Husky.

I'm building an app called [Gauntlet](http://gauntletapp.com/) with a friend. If you're into Magic: The Gathering you should check it out.
