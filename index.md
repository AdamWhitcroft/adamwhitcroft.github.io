I'm a software designer from South Africa living on an island off the west coast of Canada. You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AdamWhitcroft) or [Mastodon](https://mastodon.design/@adam). Some of my hobbies include making [app icons](https://twitter.com/AdamWhitcroft/status/1691487295822802944/photo/1), developing iOS apps, and [playing with 3D](https://twitter.com/AdamWhitcroft/status/1730605005571563685/photo/1).

I make iOS and macOS app icons for folks building fun software. If youâ€™d like to commission an icon, <a href="mailto:hey@adamwhitcroft.com?subject=App%20icon%20inquiry">send me an email</a>.

I make SwiftUI apps as well. My first was launched a little after my second child was born, and there are a couple I'm working on now.
