I've recently started designing iOS and macOS app icons in my spare time. I'm still fairly new to the whole thing, but I'm having a blast.

Shortly after the birth of my second child in 2022, I released my first iOS app. Designed and built by me in SwfitUI, it's a simple and privacy-first app for tracking feeds and diaper changes. It's called *Joey* and I'm real proud of it.
