I've spent the past 6-and-a-bit years designing websites, icons and web apps. This year, however, I'd like to spend my downtime exploring new design disciplines like lettering and illustration. This is not to say I've lost interest in what I currently do &mdash; far from it &mdash; I'm just looking to grow as a designer.

You can [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/adamwhitcroft), [drop me an email](mailto:hello@adamwhitcroft.com) or read about how I got into design in an interview I did with [The Industry](http://theindustry.cc/2013/06/24/an-interview-with-adam-whitcroft/) not too long ago.

If you're interested in learning about my process when it comes to icon design, I've recently done a class for Skillshare on the subject titled '[Icon Design: Create a Cohesive Icon Set](http://skl.sh/1rdXEdS)'.
