I joined Shopify in 2016 where I currently work as a Staff Designer. I spend my time helping teams in Logistics design the tools used by <span class="highlight">one million merchants</span> to process orders more efficiently.

I live in Ottawa with my wife, our daughter and our Husky. I don't tweet that often, but you should follow [@adamwhitcroft](https://twitter.com/AdamWhitcroft) anyway.
