I'm a South African born designer living in the United Kingdom with my beautiful wife. I've released several well known icon projects[^1] alongside other open source design helpers[^2], taught a successful Skillshare[^3] course and was interviewed by The Industry[^4] a little while back.

I'm currently doing what I can to make commerce better for everyone at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com).

Find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adamwhitcroft), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/adamwhitcroft/), [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/adamwhitcroft) &amp; [GitHub](https://github.com/AdamWhitcroft).
