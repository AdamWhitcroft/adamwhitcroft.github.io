I've been at Shopify since 2016, most recently in the role of Staff Designer. I live in Canada with my wife, daughter and Husky/Shepherd mix.

I work across multiple teams to shape the design of Logistics and Order Management, helping our <span>1 million+ merchants</span> run their businesses more efficiently.
