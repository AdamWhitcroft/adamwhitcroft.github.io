I've worked at Shopify since 2016, where I'm currently a ~~Senior Designer~~ Staff Designer. I spend my time helping the teams in our Delivery product line design and ship workflows used by over ~~500,000 750,000~~ 1,000,000 merchants to process their orders efficiently.

I live in ~~South Africa Dubai England~~ Ottawa with my wife, daughter and Husky.

I designed a few really popular icon kits, ~~you can find them here~~ but they've been retired indefinitely.

I'm building an app called [Gauntlet](http://gauntletapp.com/) with a friend. If you're into Magic: The Gathering you should check it out.

You should follow me on ~~LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram and~~ [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AdamWhitcroft).
