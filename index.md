South African product designer living on an island in British Columbia, Canada. 

I recently joined [Rewind](https://www.rewind.ai) to help design and build a native macOS app aimed at giving you perfect memory. 

Before that, I was at [Wealthsimple](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca) (Principal Designer, 1yr) and [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) (Senior Staff Designer, 6yrs).

I love making iOS and macOS app icons. I haven't been doing it all that long, but I've had the opportunity to work with some amazing founders and developers.

When our second child was born in 2022, I used his naps to learn SwiftUI and release my first app. It's called _Joey_ and it's a simple privacy-first app for tracking feeds and diaper changes. I'm real proud of it.
