South African software designer living on an island off the west coast of Canada. 

I recently joined [Rewind](https://www.rewind.ai) to help design and build a native macOS app aimed at giving you perfect memory. 

Before that, I was at [Wealthsimple](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca) (Principal Designer, 1yr) and [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) (Senior Staff Designer, 6yrs).

I love making iOS and macOS app icons. I haven't been doing it all that long, but I've had the opportunity to work with some amazing founders and developers.

In 2022 I started to learn SwiftUI while I was on parental leave, releasing my first app a couple of months later. More apps to follow.
