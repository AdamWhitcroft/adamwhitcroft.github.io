I've worked at Shopify since 2016, where I'm currently a Staff Designer. I help individual crafters and leads design and ship workflows used by over one million merchants to process their orders efficiently.

I live in Canada with my wife, daughter and Husky.

I designed a few really popular icon kits, but they've been retired indefinitely.

I'm building an app called [Gauntlet](http://gauntletapp.com/) with a friend. If you're into Magic: The Gathering you should check it out.

You should follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AdamWhitcroft), although I never tweet about product design. It's mostly gaming and MTG.
