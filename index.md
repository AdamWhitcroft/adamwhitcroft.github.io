I'm a South African product designer living on a little island in British Columbia, Canada. I'm currently designing personalized investment tools at [Wealthsimple](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca) (_Principal Designer, 1yr_).

Before joining Wealthsimple in 2022, I was at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) (_Senior Staff Designer, 6yrs_).

I love making iOS and macOS app icons. I haven't been doing it all that long, but I've had the opportunity to work with some amazing founders and developers.

When our second child was born in 2022, I used his naps to learn SwiftUI and release my first app. It's called _Joey_ and it's a simple privacy-first app for tracking feeds and diaper changes. I'm real proud of it.
