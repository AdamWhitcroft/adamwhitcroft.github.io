I've worked at Shopify since 2016, where I'm currently a Staff Designer. I help teams design and ship tools used by more than a million merchants to manage their orders and inventory. Before that, I lead the redesign of Shopify's icon ecosystem.

I'm building an app called [Gauntlet](http://gauntletapp.com/) with a friend. If you're into Magic: The Gathering check it out.

Find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AdamWhitcroft), where I don't talk about product design; it's mostly gaming, MTG or 3D related.
