South African product designer living on a little island in British Columbia, Canada. 

I'm currently exploring the future of personalized investment tools at [Wealthsimple](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca) (Principal Designer, 2022 -- Present).

Before joining Wealthsimple in 2022, I was at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) (Senior Staff Designer, 2016 –– 2022).

I love making iOS and macOS app icons. I haven't been doing it all that long, but I've had the opportunity to work with some amazing founders and developers.

When our second child was born in 2022, I used his naps to learn SwiftUI and release my first app. It's called _Joey_ and it's a simple privacy-first app for tracking feeds and diaper changes. I'm real proud of it.
