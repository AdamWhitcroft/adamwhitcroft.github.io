A South African born designer living in the United Kingdom with my beautiful wife. I've released several well known icon projects[^1] alongside other open source design helpers[^2], taught a successful Skillshare[^3] course and was interviewed by The Industry[^4] a little while back.

Currently at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com), doing what I can to make commerce better for everyone.
