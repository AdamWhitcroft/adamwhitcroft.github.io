I work at Shopify, focussing on improving the quality of our admin experiences across web and mobile. Before that I helped teams design and ship tools used by our merchants to manage their orders and inventory at scale. I created Shopify's first icon library and continue to design icons for features and teams today.

Full resume coming soon.
