I don't self-identify as a minimalist but I do enjoy owning *less*[^1]. One of the areas I channel this most is my wardrobe. The items listed below comprise my day-to-day wardrobe[^2].

I avoid animal products, and try my best to support ethical and sustainable manufacturing.

[^2]: This excludes clothes I wear at home (usually track pants and a hoodie), and anything related to sports or exercise.
