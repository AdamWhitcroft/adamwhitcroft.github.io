(this page is WIP, if you find it early, good for you)

I don't self-identify as a minimalist but I do enjoy owning _less_[^1]. One of the areas I channel this most is my wardrobe. The items listed below comprise my day-to-day wardrobe[^2].

I avoid animal products, and try my best to support ethical and sustainable manufacturing.

[^1]: With the exception of my Magic: The Gathering collection and Steam library.
[^2]: This excludes clothes I wear at home (usually track pants and a hoodie), and anything related to sports or exercise.
